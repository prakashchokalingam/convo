# ðŸš€ Getting Started with ConvoForms

Welcome to ConvoForms! This guide will get you up and running in 10 minutes.

## What is ConvoForms?

ConvoForms is an AI-powered form builder that turns boring static forms into engaging conversations. Users can:
- Generate forms using natural language prompts ("Create a job application form")
- Toggle any form into "conversational mode" (chat-like interface)
- Collect responses and analyze data

## Prerequisites

You'll need these installed:
- **Node.js 18+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Docker Desktop** - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd convo
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your API keys:
```bash
# Database (this works out of the box for local development)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://convoforms:convoforms_dev_password@localhost:5432/convoforms"

# Authentication - Get these from https://clerk.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# AI Provider - Get from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=AIza...
```

### 3. Start Database
```bash
# This starts PostgreSQL in a Docker container
npm run db:up

# Wait 5 seconds, then create tables
npm run db:push
```

### 4. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

ðŸŽ‰ **Success!** Open http://localhost:3002 to see your app.
