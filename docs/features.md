# ‚ú® ConvoForms Features

This document explains what ConvoForms does and how it works for users.

## üéØ Core Value Proposition

**Transform boring static forms into engaging conversations with AI.**

Traditional forms have 81% abandonment rates. ConvoForms reduces this to 40-60% by making forms feel like natural conversations.

## ü§ñ AI Form Generation

### How It Works
Users describe their form in natural language, and AI generates the complete form structure.

**Example Prompts:**
- "Create a job application form"
- "I need a customer feedback survey for my restaurant"
- "Build a contact form for my website"
- "Make an event registration form with meal preferences"

**AI Output:**
- Form fields with proper types (text, email, select, etc.)
- Validation rules (required fields, email format, etc.)
- Smart labels and placeholder text
- Logical field ordering
- Appropriate form settings

### Supported Field Types
- **Text Input** - Single line text with validation
- **Email** - Email validation built-in
- **Textarea** - Multi-line text for longer responses
- **Select Dropdown** - Choose from predefined options
- **Radio Buttons** - Single choice from multiple options
- **Checkboxes** - Multiple selections
- **Number** - Numeric input with min/max validation
- **Phone** - Phone number with country code
- **File Upload** - Document/image uploads

## üí¨ Conversational Mode

### The Magic Feature
Any form can be toggled into "conversational mode" - transforming it into a chat-like experience.

### How It Works
```
Traditional Form:
[Name: ______]
[Email: ______]
[Message: ______]
[Submit Button]

Conversational Mode:
Bot: "Hi! What's your name?"
User: "John Smith"
Bot: "Nice to meet you, John! What's your email?"
User: "john@example.com"
Bot: "Perfect! What would you like to tell us?"
User: "I'm interested in your services..."
Bot: "Thanks for reaching out! We'll be in touch soon."
```
