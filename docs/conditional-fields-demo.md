# Conditional Fields Feature - Complete Implementation Demo

## Overview

The conditional fields feature allows form builders to create dynamic forms where field visibility is controlled by user interactions with other fields. This creates intelligent, adaptive forms that show only relevant fields based on user inputs.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Core Conditional Logic Engine
- **Field Evaluation**: Real-time evaluation of conditional logic rules
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic tracking of field dependencies
- **Circular Dependency Prevention**: Built-in validation to prevent infinite loops
- **Multiple Operators**: Support for equals, not_equals, contains, greater_than, less_than
- **AND/OR Logic**: Combine multiple conditions with logical operators

### 2. Visual Form Builder Integration
- **Conditional Logic Builder**: Intuitive UI for configuring field conditions
- **Dependency Indicators**: Visual badges showing field relationships
- **Live Preview Mode**: Test conditional logic in real-time
- **Properties Panel Integration**: Seamless configuration within existing workflow

### 3. Advanced Functionality
- **Field Type Support**: Works with all field types (text, select, checkbox, etc.)
- **Nested Dependencies**: Fields can depend on other conditional fields
- **Show/Hide Logic**: Configure whether conditions show or hide fields
- **Validation Integration**: Hidden fields are excluded from form validation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Conditional Field

```typescript
const licenseField: FieldConfig = {
  id: 'license_number',
  type: 'text',
  label: 'Driver License Number',
  conditional: {
    show: true,
    conditions: [
      {
        fieldId: 'has_license',
        operator: 'equals',
        value: true
      }
    ],
    logic: 'and'
  }
}
```

### Multiple Conditions with AND Logic

```typescript
const vehicleField: FieldConfig = {
  id: 'vehicle_type',
  type: 'select',
  label: 'Vehicle Type',
  conditional: {
    show: true,
    conditions: [
      {
        fieldId: 'has_license',
        operator: 'equals',
        value: true
      },
      {
        fieldId: 'age',
        operator: 'greater_than',
        value: 18
      }
    ],
    logic: 'and'
  }
}
```

### Hide Field When Conditions Are Met

```typescript
const parentConsentField: FieldConfig = {
  id: 'parent_consent',
  type: 'checkbox',
  label: 'Parent Consent Required',
  conditional: {
    show: false, // Hide when conditions are met
    conditions: [
      {
        fieldId: 'age',
        operator: 'greater_than',
        value: 18
      }
    ],
    logic: 'and'
  }
}
```

## Supported Operators

### Equality Operators
- **equals**: Field value exactly matches the specified value
- **not_equals**: Field value does not match the specified value

### Numeric Operators
- **greater_than**: Numeric field value is greater than specified value
- **less_than**: Numeric field value is less than specified value

### Text Operators
- **contains**: Field value contains the specified substring
  - For arrays: checks if array contains the specified value
  - For strings: case-insensitive substring matching

## Field Type Compatibility

### Supported Field Types
- **Text Fields**: text, email, textarea, phone
- **Numeric Fields**: number, rating
- **Selection Fields**: select, multiselect, radio
- **Boolean Fields**: checkbox, switch
- **Date Fields**: date, datetime
- **File Fields**: file uploads
- **Layout Fields**: section, divider, html

### Type-Specific Behaviors
- **Select/Radio**: Only equality operators available
- **Multiselect**: Supports contains operator for value matching
- **Checkbox/Switch**: Automatically presents Yes/No options
- **Number/Date**: All operators including greater/less than comparisons

## Visual Indicators

### Dependency Badges
- **Blue Badge with Arrow Up**: Shows number of fields this field depends on
- **Green Badge with Arrow Down**: Shows number of fields that depend on this field
- **Purple Badge with Eye**: Indicates field has conditional logic configured

### Form Builder Integration
- **Properties Panel**: Dedicated "Conditional" tab for configuration
- **Test Logic Button**: Appears when conditional fields are present
- **Live Preview**: Interactive testing environment

## Advanced Features

### Circular Dependency Prevention
The system automatically detects and prevents circular dependencies:

```typescript
// This would be rejected:
fieldA.conditional = { conditions: [{ fieldId: 'fieldB', ... }] }
fieldB.conditional = { conditions: [{ fieldId: 'fieldA', ... }] }
```

### Evaluation Order
Fields are evaluated in dependency order ensuring consistent behavior:
1. Fields with no dependencies (root fields)
2. Fields depending only on root fields
3. Fields with complex nested dependencies

### Form Validation Integration
Hidden fields are automatically excluded from form validation and submission data.

## Testing and Debugging

### Preview Mode
The conditional preview mode allows testing logic before deployment:
- Interactive form with all conditional logic active
- Real-time visibility status for each field
- Debug panel showing evaluation results
- Form data preview (visible fields only)

### Validation Features
- Circular dependency detection
- Missing field reference validation
- Invalid condition value checking
- Type compatibility verification

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- **Memoized Evaluations**: Results cached until dependencies change
- **Efficient Graph Traversal**: Optimized dependency graph algorithms
- **Minimal Re-renders**: React hooks prevent unnecessary updates
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Only evaluate when field values change

### Scalability
- Handles forms with 100+ fields efficiently
- Complex dependency chains supported
- Real-time evaluation with minimal latency
- Memory-efficient dependency tracking

## Integration with Form Builder

### Seamless Workflow
1. Add fields to form as normal
2. Select field to configure conditional logic
3. Use "Conditional" tab in Properties Panel
4. Configure conditions with visual builder
5. Test logic using "Test Logic" button
6. Deploy form with conditional behavior

### Backwards Compatibility
- Existing forms work without modification
- Conditional logic is optional for each field
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Best Practices

### Designing Conditional Forms
1. **Keep it Simple**: Start with basic show/hide logic
2. **Logical Flow**: Ensure conditions make sense to users
3. **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Limit dependency chains to 3-4 levels
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Use preview mode to validate all scenarios
5. **Clear Labels**: Make field relationships obvious to users

### Performance Tips
1. **Minimize Dependencies**: Reduce the number of fields each field depends on
2. **Early Evaluation**: Place frequently changing fields early in form
3. **Strategic Grouping**: Group related conditional fields together
4. **Test at Scale**: Validate performance with realistic form sizes

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Conditional Sections**: Show/hide entire form sections
- **Dynamic Field Values**: Auto-populate fields based on conditions
- **Advanced Operators**: Regular expressions, date ranges
- **Conditional Validation**: Change validation rules based on conditions
- **Performance Analytics**: Track conditional logic performance
- **Template Library**: Pre-built conditional patterns

### API Extensions
- **REST API**: Conditional logic configuration via API
- **Webhooks**: Trigger external actions on visibility changes
- **Analytics Integration**: Track field visibility patterns
- **A/B Testing**: Test different conditional logic variants

## Conclusion

The conditional fields feature transforms static forms into intelligent, adaptive interfaces that respond to user input. With comprehensive validation, visual design tools, and robust performance, it enables creation of sophisticated form experiences while maintaining ease of use for form builders.

The implementation provides a solid foundation for advanced form logic while remaining accessible to users of all technical levels. The visual builder, live preview, and comprehensive testing tools ensure that complex conditional forms can be created and maintained with confidence.
