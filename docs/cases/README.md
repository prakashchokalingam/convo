# ConvoForms: Use Cases, Scenarios & Technical Deep Dives

This directory serves as a knowledge base, containing detailed documents that explore:
- Specific use cases and user scenarios.
- In-depth explanations of particular features or functionalities.
- Discussions of edge cases and how they are handled.
- Documentation of past technical decisions or complex implementations.

These documents are intended to supplement the main architecture and development guides by providing more granular detail on specific topics. They can be particularly useful for understanding the nuances of certain system behaviors or for onboarding new team members to complex parts of the application.

## üìÅ Document Organization

The documents are loosely categorized by the primary area they concern. Note that some documents might cover aspects of multiple categories.

### Core Application & User Flows
- **`authentication.md`**: Details user signup, login, logout flows, onboarding, and authentication context protection.
- **`workspace-management.md`**: Covers workspace creation, switching, member management, and role-based access control (RBAC) within workspaces.
- **`form-generation.md`**: Explains the AI-powered form creation process from user prompts, including schema generation and validation.
- **`form-builder.md`**: Describes the manual form building interface, including field types, properties, drag-and-drop functionality, settings, and conversational mode.
- **`form-submission.md`**: (Assumed, link to be created if file exists) Details the public form submission process, data collection, validation, and response handling.
- **`subdomain-routing.md`**: Explains context detection (marketing, app, forms) and URL handling based on subdomains.
- **`path-based-routing.md`**: (Assumed, link to be created if file exists) Documents any path-based routing logic if distinct from subdomain routing.

### Features & Business Logic
- **`pricing-plans.md`**: (Assumed, link to be created if file exists) Outlines subscription tiers, feature entitlements, and billing integration logic.
- **`member-invites.md`**: (Assumed, link to be created if file exists) Covers the process for inviting team members to workspaces and managing their access.
- **`analytics.md`**: Describes how form response data is tracked, aggregated, and presented for insights.
- **`templates-feature.md`**: Details the functionality for creating, using, and managing form templates.
- **`v2-website.md`**: (Assumed, link to be created if file exists) Documentation related to a V2 version of the website, if applicable.
- **`automatic-workspace-creation.md`**: (Note: This might be a duplicate or older version of `docs/technical_details/implementation-automatic-workspace-creation.md`. Review for consolidation.)

### Technical Infrastructure & API
- **`api-endpoints.md`**: Provides an overview or specific details about key backend API endpoints, their validation, and expected behavior.
- **`database-operations.md`**: (Assumed, link to be created if file exists) May cover specific database operations, data integrity rules, or complex queries not detailed elsewhere.
- **`performance.md`**: (Assumed, link to be created if file exists) Could discuss performance considerations, load testing results, or optimization strategies for specific parts of the application.
- **`e2e-testing.md`**: (Note: This might be better suited as a primary guide in `docs/guides/` or linked from `DEVELOPMENT.md`. Included here if it contains specific scenarios or case studies for E2E tests.)
- **`form-creation-id-generation.md`**: Details the logic and mechanisms behind generating unique IDs for forms.

## üìÑ Document Structure & Status

While the structure may vary, many documents in this section, especially those detailing features or flows, might include:
- **Objective/Goal**: What the feature or flow achieves.
- **Key Scenarios**: Step-by-step descriptions of user interactions or system processes.
- **Technical Details**: Relevant implementation notes, data models, or algorithms.
- **Acceptance Criteria/Verification Points**: Checklists or specific points to verify functionality (as seen in `authentication.md` and `form-builder.md`).

Some documents may include a **Status** indicator (e.g., üöß Implemented, Needs Testing, ‚úÖ Complete). This helps track the maturity or relevance of the information.

If you are looking for formal, executable test cases, please refer to the `__tests__/` directory for automated tests or specific QA plans if available.
