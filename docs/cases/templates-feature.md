# Templates Feature - Test Cases

## Feature Overview
Template system allowing users to create forms from pre-defined global templates or user-created workspace templates. Access and operations are controlled by granular, resource-based permissions (e.g., `create_template`, `edit_template`, `delete_template`) rather than broad roles, with usage tracking.
