- [ ] Respects form submission limits
- [ ] Returns appropriate success/error responses

## Test Case 4: Workspace Setup API (`/api/setup-workspace`)

### When

- New user completes onboarding
- Workspace creation with unique slug

### Then

- Workspace created in database
- User assigned as owner
- Default settings applied

### Verify

- [ ] Requires authentication
- [ ] Validates workspace name and slug
- [ ] Enforces slug uniqueness
- [ ] Creates workspace with owner role
- [ ] Returns workspace data for redirection
- [ ] Handles creation failures gracefully

## Test Case 5: Form Saving API (`/api/forms/save`)

### When

- User saves form from builder
- Form schema and settings provided

### Then

- Form data persisted correctly
- Version control if implemented
- Real-time collaboration support

### Verify

- [ ] Validates complete form schema
- [ ] Handles partial saves (draft mode)
- [ ] Updates modification timestamps
- [ ] Maintains form version history
- [ ] Supports concurrent editing protection
- [ ] Returns saved form data

## Test Case 6: Authentication Integration

### When

- API endpoints require authentication
- Clerk JWT tokens validated

### Then

- Secure access control
- User context available in handlers
- Proper error responses for unauthorized access

### Verify

- [ ] All protected endpoints validate Clerk tokens
- [ ] User ID extracted correctly from tokens
- [ ] 401 responses for invalid/missing tokens
- [ ] 403 responses for insufficient permissions
- [ ] Token refresh handling
- [ ] Rate limiting per authenticated user

## Test Case 7: Error Handling and Validation

### When

- Invalid data sent to APIs
- Server errors occur during processing

### Then

- Consistent error response format
- Helpful error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes

### Verify

- [ ] 400 for validation errors with field details
- [ ] 404 for not found resources
- [ ] 429 for rate limit exceeded
- [ ] 500 for server errors with error ID
- [ ] Consistent error response structure
- [ ] No sensitive data in error messages

## Test Case 8: File Upload Handling

### When

- Forms include file upload fields
- Users submit files via API

### Then

- Secure file processing
- Virus scanning and validation
- Proper storage and retrieval

### Verify

- [ ] File type validation (whitelist approach)
- [ ] File size limits enforced
- [ ] Virus scanning integration
- [ ] Secure file storage (S3/similar)
- [ ] File URL generation with expiry
- [ ] Cleanup of orphaned files

## Test Case 9: API Performance and Monitoring

### When

- High volume of API requests
- Performance monitoring active

### Then

- Acceptable response times
- Proper resource utilization
- Monitoring data collected

### Verify

- [ ] Response times under 2 seconds for most endpoints
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Memory usage within limits
- [ ] API metrics collected (response time, error rate)
- [ ] Logging for debugging and audit
- [ ] Graceful degradation under load

## Test Case 10: Webhook and Integration APIs

### When

- External services need to integrate
- Webhook endpoints configured

### Then
